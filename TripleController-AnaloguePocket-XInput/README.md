# Triple Controller to USB - XInput Edition

This alternative firmware will allow the Triple Controller to appear a single XInput controller that all 3 controller inputs share. The controller inputs have been mapped to align with the default mapping on the Analogue Pocket Dock (as of firmware 1.1 Beta 6)

Uses the XInput Arduino Library - https://github.com/dmadison/ArduinoXInput
